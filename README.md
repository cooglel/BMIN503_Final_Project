# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

This repository contains the final written report and GitHub repository for my final project. This project explores secure chat data, an electronic health record based communication tool, at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. As part of a larger initiative to reengineer inter-professional communication work stystems, secure chat burden was examined for infectious disease fellows on call overnight. This initial data exploration will help inform project design and development.
